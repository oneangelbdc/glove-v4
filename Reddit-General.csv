"this actually happened a couple of years ago. i grew up in germany where i went to a german secondary school that went from 5th to 13th grade (we still had 13 grades then, they have since changed that). my school was named after anne frank and we had a club that i was very active in from 9th grade on, which was dedicated to teaching incoming 5th graders about anne franks life, discrimination, anti-semitism, hitler, the third reich and that whole spiel. basically a day where the students' classes are cancelled and instead we give them an interactive history and social studies class with lots of activities and games. this was my last year at school and i already had a lot of experience doing these project days with the kids. i was running the thing with a friend, so it was just the two of us and 30-something 5th graders. we start off with a brief introduction and brainstorming: what do they know about anne frank and the third reich? you'd be surprised how much they know. anyway after the brainstorming we do a few activities, and then we take a short break. after the break we split the class into two groups to make it easier to handle. one group watches a short movie about anne frank while the other gets a tour through our poster presentation that our student group has been perfecting over the years. then the groups switch. i'm in the classroom to show my group the movie and i take attendance to make sure no one decided to run away during break. i'm going down the list when i come to the name sandra (name changed). a kid with a boyish haircut and a somewhat deeper voice, wearing clothes from the boy's section at a big clothing chain in germany, pipes up. now keep in mind, these are all 11 year olds, they are all pre-pubescent, their bodies are not yet showing any sex specific features one would be able to see while they are fully clothed (e.g. boobs, beards,...). this being a 5th grade in the rather conservative (for german standards) bavaria, i was confused. i looked down at the list again making sure i had read the name right. look back up at the kid. me: ""you're sandra?"" kid: ""yep."" me: ""oh, sorry. *thinking the kid must be from somewhere where sandra is both a girl's and boy's name* where are you from? i've only ever heard that as a girl's name before."" the class starts laughing. sandra gets really quiet. ""i am a girl..."" she says. some of the other students start saying that their parents made the same mistake when they met sandra. i feel so sorry and stupid. i get the class to calm down and finish taking attendance. we watch the movie in silence. after the movie, when we walked down to where the poster presentation took place i apologised to sandra. i felt so incredibly terrible, i still do to this day. throughout the rest of the day i heard lots of whispers about sandra. i tried to stop them whenever they came up, but there was no stopping the 5th grade gossip i had set in motion. sandra, if you're out there, i am so incredibly sorry for humiliating you in front of your class. i hope you are happy and healthy and continue to live your life the way you like. don't let anyone tell you you have to dress or act a certain way just because of the body parts you were born with. i'm sorry if i made you feel like you were wrong for dressing and acting differently. i'm sorry i probably made that day hell for you. i'm sorry for my ignorance.",confuse a 5th grade girl for a boy in front of half of her class. kids are mean. sorry sandra.**
"it was last october, but i'm feeling the fall-out from it the most today. after my mom died from cancer last year, i started looking for my estranged father. i had only known him for a short time when i was 6 and barely remembered more than his name. i never knew why he left and my mom would not talk about him without obvious emotional pain, so i didn't push her for information about him. i figured he didn't care about us. i had googled him multiple times over the years, but he was always unlisted and i didn't have an address with which to search. after her death, i felt strongly that he should at least know that she died and that i have a beautiful little girl. it felt wrong that he might be out there somewhere knowing nothing about us. i googled him again and came up with a phone number and address that seemed realistic. i called, figuring it was going to be another person by the same name since i'd already experienced that several times while looking for him. it wasn't. i had no idea how he would react to me, but he was ecstatic. he told me that he had been a horrible alcoholic and that he didn't pursue custody of me because he felt himself to be selfish and unstable. he said he knew that my mom and my family would love me and take wonderful care of me (he was right about that! my mom was the best woman i've ever known). so, we started talking and skyping. we spent a lot of time learning about each other. knowing how he had hurt my mom and bailed on me made it difficult to see him as the person he has grown to be, but i tried to believe that people can change for the better. he was exactly everything i needed in a father my entire life: supportive, sweet, funny, loving. eventually, i told him that i loved him after months of talking with him. he was over-the-moon. fast-forward to actually meeting him in person. this is the part where, without knowing my dad or me, you might feel that i sound like an ass. i say this because i don't have a precise reason or event that i can point to as to why i don't trust him. why he actually makes me really nervous. my dad is really touchy and hovers all of the time. he doesn't smell clean and his teeth are rotting and crumbled. he doesn't give personal space and, when i spent a couple of nights staying at his trailer, he kept coming in to my room to check on me while i was sleeping. he said that he was just so excited to have me there that he couldn't help it, but i really felt uncomfortable with it. i couldn't sleep and was so glad that i didn't even consider bringing my daughter without spending time with him first. he also asked me if he could kiss me on the mouth because his family does. i said ""no"" and he accepted that, but the constant touchiness continued. it wasn't anything strictly inappropriate, but it made my skin crawl. i've spent very little actual time with him in person, maybe 2 weeks total over several trips. i have, however, talked with him for countless hours on the phone and skype. during the most acute months of grieving for my mom, he was so devoted to me, trying to talk me through whatever he could. i was so grateful for it that i kept ignoring details about his character that really concerned me. he actually demanded a lot of my time, like hours and hours every day and would get upset if i cited my daughter and husband as reasons that i needed to chill with the phone. he never paid my mom child support and obviously was never there for us my entire life. he also evaded taxes and told me he had been to court 9 times and jail once. again, i know people can change, but at this point, i find myself wanting less contact with him. the idea of him spending any time with my daughter alone is out of the question and my husband feels the same concerns. i don't want to hurt him, but i just can't trust him. i don't even know if i'm asking for advice or confessing to being stupid and rushing into something that will hurt someone. thank you for reading and i sincerely want to wish all the wonderful father's out there a very happy father's day! eta:","i found my estranged dad, thought i loved him after getting to know him, got to know him better and changed my mind."
"so i had the brilliant idea to use veet hair removal gel as the ol' danglies were in need of a trim and i had heard that veet leaves them smoother for longer. well i guess thats right when the skin has to grow back first. pre-story: i tried this before and the results were great but i had decided to do it again because of how well it worked. so i take out the gel/cream stuff and just lob it on and cover the forest. the slight peroxide kinda smell ensued and all was going well, there was a slight burning but thats to be expected, you know, melting pubes off does that. so comes the all and mighty time of scraping that stuff off, top half all good, no pain or anything. but, the danglies were what was burning, i scraped them and withstood the pain because well lets face it, men are men and a little pain for balls as smooth as jam jars is fine right? wrong, it did great at taking the hair off it, but decided to take the first layer of skin too, my nuts now glow cherry red and walking is a painful expense that can't be justified. i feel sauron has just tipped them in mount doom and dragged me balls first down the side of a rock wall.",had my balls burned by sauron and was left deveeted.
"today i was going to have a bath after a long day of painting kids faces at a carnival. all would go well, except being the genius i am, i put in some epsom salts (i always do for my bath), and i grabbed my bottle of peppermint essential oil. lately, i've been on a diy-pinterest-tumblr-let's-make-my-own-shit-and-be-fancy spree. the other day i took a 'detox bath' (fyi did nothing for me guys. uselessss). so, my brain totally went 'hey, trajectorys, put some peppermint in! it's good for your skin!' okay brain! so, instead of logically putting in like... 5 drops so it's nice and minty fresh smelling and just enough to work, i literally shook the thing full force all over the top of the bath water. i'm talking like... probably 50-100 drops. so i finish running the water, turn it off, and hop in. first five minutes went really well.. and then the cold started. okay, this is fine, it just is the peppermint cooling my skin. brain is like, just wait it out. so i stayed in. ten minutes in and i'm moving back and forth trying to keep the warm water warm, if i stopped moving it was like sitting in the water at the foot of a glacier. so i sit up. you know that feeling when you brush your teeth and drink ice water? that immense cold in your mouth? my back felt like that immediately. so now i'm sitting here and my back, my butt, and my ladybits are burning cold. like, sitting in the snow naked kind of cold. it's really uncomfortable... so indeed, tifu.",peppermint + bath = burning cold ladybits.
"i haven't had a bath in practically years so, after finally moving into a house with a bath, i decide to have one. having recently purchased a shiny new bag of weed, i thought combining the two would be a good idea. picture this; a very cramped bathroom, no windows, a shitty extractor fan, closed door, steaming hot bath and a spliff. as i lay there gently swishing to and fro, giggling like a little school girl, i neglected to notice how hot the room was becoming. after a while i looked up and realised i could barely even see the taps in front of me. naturally, i begin to panic and started scrambling around trying to escape. i grabbed a towel, stood up and immediately fell back to the floor. all i could see was black for what felt like 5 minutes, my heart was pounding and i could feel the blood rushing past my ears. once the feeling passed i stumbled into my bedroom and stood in front of the mirror, facing me was an extremely red version of myself with a bleeding shoulder. currently, my heart rate has almost returned to normal and i'm starting to feel and look less like a lobster. 2/10 would not recommend.","got too high and too hot in the bath, almost cooked myself like a lobster."
